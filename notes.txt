1. What is an ideal thread pool size ?
Depends on Task type -> CPU Intensive, IO Bound

CPU Bound Task - With same number of cores increasing thread count doesn't speed up task completion.
Ideal Thread Pool Size = Number of CPU Cores (You can check number of cpu cores by calling 
Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()



IO Bound Task - Even with same number of cores, increasing thread count can speed up completion.
Number of threads that can be added for each CPU core, depends on how much time it takes for 
tasks IO operation to complete.

Ideal Thread Count = Number of Cores * (1 + Wait Time / CPU Time)

Other Factors
- Are there any other applications running on same CPU
- Are there other executor services or threads running in same JVM application
- Threads are heavy weight (1-2MB). Cannot create thousands of them. Even if a task IO Operation allows
space for thousand threads.
- Too many threads will also have added complexity time-taken for thread switching
- Too many threads also affect data locality (i.e. L1/L2 etc need to be flushed during thread switch)


Volatile vs Atomic Operations
Use volatile when there are visibility problem (e.g there are 2 threads running one thread is modifying boolean flag 
& other thread based on boolean flag condition is processing value modified by thread one is not visible to thread two
it requires flush to shared memory and refresh of values from shared memory to thread cache)

Atomic - Use when you want to perform operations as single unit of work (e.g Increasing / Decreasing Counters AtomicIntegers,
AtomicLong)

AtomicReference - Caches (Building new cache in background and replacing atomically) used by internal classes. Non-Blocking algorithms

ThreadLocal - Per Thread instances for memory efficiency and thread-safety.
(e.g usage request comes to server it fetches user profile and there are separate back-end which requires user data instead of 
having thread safe / synchronized map each thread have its user profile

- Per Thread context (thread-safety + Performance)
Spring uses lot of context holders - LocaleContextHolder, TransactionContextHolder, RequestContextHolder, SecurityContextHolder,
DateTimeContextHolder

- Thread Confinement
- Per Thread object for perf
- Per Thread context

Usage Tips
- clean up once out of scope
- use local variables
- delegate to frameworks

Locks vs Synchronized
Lock framework works like synchronized blocks except 
locks can be more sophisticated than Java’s synchronized blocks. Locks allow more flexible structuring of synchronized code.
scope can expand to multiple methods + you can acquire multiple locks and you can have conditions 

Reentrant Lock u can call it multiple times on same object 
e.g private static accessResource(){
lock.lock();
if(someCondition){
	//Recursion call
	accessResource
}
lock.unlock ; //Always surround with finally 

Lock Fairness
new RentrantLock(true) //Lock is fair longest waiting thread will acquire lock first

Unfair Locks
new RentrantLock(false) //Barge in possible starvation

lock.tryLock();
lock.tryLock(timeout:1, TimeUnit.Seconds);

Reentrant Lock vs Reentrant Read Write Lock
Reentrant Lock only one thread at a time
ReentrantReadWrite Lock one writer at a time + multiple readers at a time. Only Read or write at a a time 
ReentrantReadWrite lock = new ReentrantReadWrite();
ReentrantReadWrite.ReadLock readLock = lock.readLock();
ReentrantReadWrite.WriteLock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

Semaphore - Resources which are in limited quantity and want to restrict it 
Acquire Permits 
release()
